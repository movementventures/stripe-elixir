defmodule Stripe.Customers do
  @moduledoc """
  Customer objects allow you to perform recurring charges and track multiple
  charges that are associated with the same customer. The API allows you to
  create, delete, and update your customers. You can retrieve individual
  customers as well as a list of all your customers.
  """

  @endpoint "customers"

  @doc """
  Creates a new customer object.

  ## Arguments

  - `account_balance` - `optional` - An integer amount in cents that is the
      starting account balance for your customer. A negative amount represents a
      credit that will be used before attempting any charges to the customer’s
      card; a positive amount will be added to the next invoice.
  - `card` - `optional` - The card can either be a token, like the ones returned
      by our Stripe.js, or a dictionary containing a user’s credit card details
      (with the options shown below). Passing card will create a new card, make
      it the new customer default card, and delete the old customer default if
      one exists. If you want to add additional cards instead of replacing the
      existing default, use the card creation API. Whenever you attach a card to
      a customer, Stripe will automatically validate the card.
      - `number` - required - The card number, as a string without any
          separators.
      - `exp_month` - required - Two digit number representing the card's
          expiration month.
      - `exp_year` - required - Two or four digit number representing the
          card's expiration year.
      - `cvc` - optional, highly recommended - Card security code.
      - `name` - optional - Cardholder's full name.
      - `address_line1` - optional
      - `address_line2` - optional
      - `address_city` - optional
      - `address_zip` - optional
      - `address_state` - optional
      - `address_country` - optional
  - `coupon` - `optional` - If you provide a coupon code, the customer will have
      a discount applied on all recurring charges. Charges you create through
      the API will not have the discount.
  - `description` - `optional` - An arbitrary string that you can attach to a
      customer object. It is displayed alongside the customer in the dashboard.
      This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
  - `email` - `optional` - Customer’s email address. It’s displayed alongside
      the customer in your dashboard and can be useful for searching and
      tracking. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
  - `metadata` - `optional` - A set of key/value pairs that you can attach to a
      customer object. It can be useful for storing additional information about
      the customer in a structured format. This will be unset if you POST an
      empty value.
  - `plan` - `optional` - The identifier of the plan to subscribe the customer
      to. If provided, the returned customer object will have a list of
      subscriptions that the customer is currently subscribed to. If you
      subscribe a customer to a plan without a free trial, the customer must
      have a valid card as well.
  - `quantity` - `optional` - The quantity you’d like to apply to the
      subscription you’re creating (if you pass in a plan). For example, if your
      plan is 10 cents/user/month, and your customer has 5 users, you could pass
      5 as the quantity to have the customer charged 50 cents (5 x 10 cents)
      monthly. Defaults to 1 if not set. Only applies when the plan parameter is
      also provided.
  - `trial_end` - `optional` - Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial
      period the customer will get before being charged for the first time. If
      set, trial_end will override the default trial period of the plan the
      customer is being subscribed to. The special value now can be provided to
      end the customer’s trial immediately. Only applies when the plan parameter
      is also provided.

  ## Returns

  Returns a customer object if the call succeeded. The returned object will have
  information about subscriptions, discount, and cards, if that information has
  been provided. If a non-free plan is specified and a card is not provided
  (unless the plan has a trial period), the call will return an error. If a
  non-existent plan or a non-existent or expired coupon is provided, the call
  will return an error.

  If a card has been attached to the customer, the returned customer object will
  have a default_card attribute, which is an ID that can be expanded into the
  full card details when retrieving the customer.
