defmodule Stripe.Plans do
  @moduledoc """
  A subscription plan contains the pricing information for different products
  and feature levels on your site. For example, you might have a $10/month
  plan for basic features and a different $20/month plan for premium features.

  @doc """
  You can create plans easily via the plan management page of the Stripe
  dashboard. Plan creation is also accessible via the API if you need to
  create plans on the fly.

  ## Arguments

  - `id` - required - Unique string of your choice that will be used to
      identify this plan when subscribing a customer. This could be an
      identifier like "gold" or a primary key from your own database.
  - `amount` - required - A positive integer in cents (or 0 for a free plan)
      representing how much to charge (on a recurring basis).
  - `currency` - required - 3-letter ISO code for currency.
  - `interval` - required - Specifies billing frequency. Either week, month
      or year.
  - `interval_count` - optional - default is 1 - The number of intervals
      between each subscription billing. For example, interval=month and
      interval_count=3 bills every 3 months. Maximum of one year
  - `interval` - allowed -  (1 year, 12 months, or 52 weeks).
  - `name` - required - Name of the plan, to be displayed on invoices and in
      the web interface.
  - `trial_period_days` - optional - Specifies a trial period in (an integer
      number of) days. If you include a trial period, the customer won't be
      billed for the first time until the trial period ends. If the customer
      cancels before the trial period is over, she'll never be billed at all.
  - `metadata` - optional - default is { } - A set of key/value pairs that
      you can attach to a plan object. It can be useful for storing
      additional information about the plan in a structured format.
  - `statement_description` - optional - default is null - An arbitrary
      string to be displayed on your customers' credit card statements
      (alongside your company name) for charges created by this plan. This
      may be up to 15 characters. As an example, if your website is RunClub
      and you specify Silver Plan, the user will see RUNCLUB SILVER PLAN.
      The statement description may not include `<>"'` characters. While
      most banks display this information consistently, some may display
      it incorrectly or not at all.
